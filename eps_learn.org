TMSI(Temporary Mobile subscriber indenties)
 In order to support the subscriber identity confidentiality service the VLRs, SGSNs and MMEs may allocate Temporary Mobile Subscriber Identities (TIMSI) to 
 visiting mobile subscribers. The VLR, SGSN, and MME must be capable of correlating an allocated TIMSI with the IMSI of the Mobile Station (MS) to which it is allocated.

An MS may be allocated three TMSIs, one for services provided through the MSC, one for services provided through the SGSN (P-TIMSI for short) and i
one for the services provided via the MME (M-TIMSI which is part of GUTI).

MSIN: Moblie subscriber identification number
    Mobile Country Code (MCC) consisting of three digits. The MSS identifies uniquely the country of domicile of mobile subscriber. 
    Mobile Network Code (MNC) consisting of two or three digits for GSM/UMTS applications.  That's why, if you are close to your country border UE is still using eNodeBs 
    that belongs/are controled by Mobile Operator from your country. In other words .. the MNC identifies the home PLMN of the mobile subscriber. The length of the MNC 
    (two or three digits) depends on the value of the MCC. A mixture of two and three digit MNC codes within a single MCC area is not recommended according to 3GPP specification.
    Mobile Subscriber Identification Number (MSIN) identifying the mobile subscriber within a PLMN.

In Fig. 1. there is also shown NMSI entity. The National Mobile Subscriber Identity (NMSI) consists of the MNC and the NMSI.

this will be allocated to each mobile subsriber in every (GSM, UMTS and EPS)sytem.

** IMEI: a number which is burned into a mobile phone
IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) it is a unique number given to every single mobile phone.
(When a phone is reported stolen or is not type approved, the number is marked invalid).

The IMEI (International Mobile Station Equipment Identity) is a 15-digit number to uniquely identify a mobile phone device.i
IMEISV (IMEI Software Version) is a 16-digit number with the IMEI and an additional software version number.

MME Identifier = MME Group ID + MME Code
MCC and MNC shall have the same field size as in earlier 3GPP systems.
M-TMSI shall be of 32 bits length.
MME Group ID shall be of 16 bits length.
MME Code shall be of 8 bits length.




** Globally Unique Temporary UE Identity (GUTI )
The purporse of the GUTI is to provife an unambiguous identification of the UE that does not reveal the UE or the user's permanent identity in the Evolved Packet System
(EPS). It also allows the identification of the MME and network. It can be used by network and the UE to establish UE's identity during signaling between them in EPS.
On GUTI consist two main components:

    GUMMEI - that uniquely identifies the MME which has allocated the GUTI
    M-TMSI - other that uniquely identifies the UE within the MME because of allocated the GUTI

Because of that when UE is contacting the network it sends the GUTI to the eNodeB which then uses the GUTI number to identify to which MME re-establish request will be send.
If the UE has moved from UMTS cell to LTE cell, a TAU procedure is made (because UE does not have its GUTI) and P-TMSI is send. By this way MME, which is in control of
area to which UE moved to, can contact SGSN, which controlled area where UE was previously, to request the subscribers current profile like IP address and PDP contexts.
Situation is similiar when UE has moved from LTE to UMTS cell. GUTI is sent as the P-TMSI parameter and the procedure is reffered as Routing Area Update (RAU).
If there is a situation where eNodeB from new LTE cell is not associated with MME on which GUMMEI is pointing eNodeB simply will select new MME. The new MME 
could get context information from old MME using same GUTI.

* PDN, bearer and APN
** PDN concept
In that home, the APN comes into play inside the Home Subscriber Server (HSS) node of the core network.

Where You’ll See LTE APN

The HSS contains users’ SAE subscription data such as the EPS-subscribed Quality of Service (QoS) profile and any access restrictions for roaming. HSS also contains
information about the (Pocket Data Networks) PDNs to which the user can connect, as reported by Alcatel-Lucent. “This could be in the form of an access point name (APN) (which is a label according to DNS naming conventions describing thei
access point to the PDN) or a PDN address (indicating subscribed IP address(es)). In addition the HSS holds dynamic information such as the identity of the MME to which the user
is currently attached or registered. The HSS may also integrate the authentication center (AUC), which generates the vectors for authentication and security keys.” [1]

 What LTE APN Does

 To break it down, the APN identifies a Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN) or Packet Data Network GateWay (P-GW). It includes an APN network identifier which defines the Packet Data 
 Network (PDN) to which the UE requests connectivity, and may also include an APN operator identifier which defines in which Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN) the P-GW or
 GGSN is located, according to LTE World. [2] To accomplish this, the APN structure is comprised into two parts: a network identifier and an operator identifier.

  How to identify?

  There are also steps for identifying a PDN IP network that the mobile data user wants to communicate with. The NMC Consulting Group notes that the PDN Identity (APN) is used to
  determine the P-GW and point of interconnection with a PDN. With APN as query parameter to the DNS procedures, the MME will receive a list of candidate P-GWs, and then a P-GW is 
  selected by MME with policy. [3]

  3GPP Views

  The board who sets the standards for 3GPP, however, sees things a little differently. According to the new standards puts in place, the UE shall not include APN and PCO in the 
  PDN connectivity request when the same is sent along with attach request. 3GPP has said that the UE shall send the PDN connectivity request with a flag “ESM Information transfer”
  on and no APN or PCO shall be included. Once the MME receives the Attach Request+PDN connectivity request, it can move ahead and accept the attach but it still cannot establish
  the EPS bearers just yet.
  Next, MME goes ahead with establishing security context. After the security context is established MME will send a NAS message “ESM Information Request” asking UE for APN and PCO. 
  Then, the UE will send an “ESM Information Response” with APN and PCO, encrypted. Finally, once MME receives this response it will go ahed with establishing the EPS bearers.
  If the response doesn’t include APN then default APN shall be used by MME.
  
  "ESM Information Request" will be sent by MME when attach request's 
       eSMInformationTransferFlag { eIT e_esm_information_transfer_required(1) }   #### when this flag is not omitted.

*** EPS Session

IP connection between a UE and a PDN is called PDN connection or EPS session. Each PDN connection (or EPS session) is represented by an IP address of the UE and a PDN ID (in other words,
 Access Point Name (APN)). It has more than one EPS bearer to deliver user traffic (IP packets), and applies the service quality (QoS) policy obtained from a PCRF to the EPS bearers.
 The minimum fundamental bearer that an EPS session has for a PDN is called a default EPS bearer.

 
Having an EPS session established means 
i) a PDN through which a user is to use services has been selected (by the user’s input or based on the subscription information provisioned by an HSS), 
ii) an IP address to be used in the PDN has been assigned to the user, 
iii) policy rules to be applied to the user IP packets (QoS and charging rules) have been selected,
iv) a default EPS bearer for delivering IP packets over the LTE network has been established. 
Through this EPS session established, IP packets can be exchanged between the user and the PDN according to the rules set by the operator.

Management and operation of sessions, including PCRF, will be explained in other document, and a PDN ID (APN) will be discussed as an ID relating to the EPS session in this document.


*** EPS Bearer

An EPS session is in charge of delivering and handling flows of the IP packets that are labeled with UE IP addresses and travel between a UE and a PDN (UE – P-GW – PDN).
 On the other hand, an EPS bearer is a pipe through which IP packets are delivered over the LTE network, i.e., between a UE and a P-GW (UE – eNB – S-GW - P-GW).
 A UE can have multiple EPS bearers concurrently. So, different EPS bearers are identified by their EPS bearer ID, which is allocated by an MME.

As seen in Figure 1, an EPS bearer actually is a concatenation of the following three bearers (DRB, S1 bearer and S5 bearer):

    [UE] - [eNB]: Data Radio Bearer (DRB)

EPS bearer established over LTE-Uu interface. User traffic (IP packet) is delivered through a DRB. Different DRBs are identified by their DRB ID, which is allocated by an eNB.

    [eNB] - [S-GW]: S1 bearer

EPS bearer established over S1-U interface. User traffic is delivered through a GTP tunnel. Different S1 bearers are identified by their tunnel endpoint identifier (TEID), which is allocated by the endpoints (eNB and S-GW) of the GTP tunnel. 

    [S-GW] - [P-GW]: S5 bearer

EPS bearer established over S5 interface. User traffic is delivered through a GTP tunnel. Different S5 bearers are identified by their tunnel endpoint identifier (TEID), which is allocated by the endpoints (S-GW and P-GW) of the GTP tunnel.

*** Types of EPS Bearers
Before we go ahead and describe EPS bearer-related IDs, we will look at different types of EPS bearers and how they work. Figure 2 shows two different types of EPS bearers:
default and dedicated. Each PDN must have one default EPS bearer, but may have none to many dedicated EPS bearers.

Despite the similarities in the processes among GSM, UMTS and LTE, there is nevertheles one major difference between LTE and earlier technologies./
the attach process already includes the assignment of an IP address. This is unlike in GSM and UMTS where the device could attach to packet-switched network and only later request for the 
assignment of and IP address with a separate procedure which often referred to aas "packet call" to compare the estbablishment of an INternet session with the voice call.
So if 4g attached ue(with a dedicated bearer for voip) handover to a 3g network, voip bearer will be 
handover to MSC, and default bearer will be released, not handover to RNC, for 3g attachment not request a default bearer.

The LTE network is an all-IP network, and provides its users with always-on IP connectivity. This means, once a UE connects to a PDN using the IP address assigned at its initial attach 
to the network, the IP connection remains connected after a default EPS bearer is established over the LTE network and until the UE detaches from the LTE network 
(i.e., the PDN connection is terminated). Even when there is no user traffic to send, the default EPS bearer always stays activated and ready for possible incoming user traffic.

Additional EPS bearer can be established if the default EPS bearer itself is not sufficient enough to obtain QoS (see LTE QoS document). The additional EPS bearer established 
is called a dedicated EPS bearer and multiple dedicated bearers can be created if required by the user or the network. When there is no user traffic, these dedicated EPS bearers 
can be removed, whereas the default one is never removed and keeps the user staying connected to the network unless the user detaches from the network. Dedicated EPS bearers are linked to
a default EPS bearer. The linked bearers are represented by a Linked EPS Bearer Identity (LBI), indicating they are all associated with the same default EPS bearer.


*** ID to identify PDN: PDN ID (APN)
PDNs are identified by PDN IDs (or Access Point Names (APNs)). An APN, as can be easily inferred, refers to an access point to a PDN where a user wishes to connect for services/applications.
APNs and their format are illustrated. An APN is a combination of a network ID and an operator ID. The network ID is used when identifying PDNs such as Internet or Corporate VPNs or 
identifying services like IMS that the PDN provides.
An APN is provisioned to an HSS as subscription information at the time of a user’s subscription (as in case 1 of Figure 3)2. Upon a UE’s initial attach, a default APN is 
downloaded from the HSS to an MME. The MME selects a PDN to connect the UE based on the APN first, and then a P-GW through which the UE is connected to the PDN . 
the MME selected PDN 1 based on APN 1, and then P-GW 1 for connection to PDN 1.

*** Types of EMM procedures
**** EMM common procedures (can be initiated whilst a NAS signalling connetion exists)
initiated by network:
GUTI reallocation;  authentication;  security mode control;  identification;     EMM information;

**** EMM specific procedures(at any time only one UE initiated EMM specific procedures can be running)

**** EMMM connection management procedures
service request;   paging procedure;   trasnport of NAS messages.

** EPS session management(ESM)
An EPS bearer context can be either a default bearer context or a dedicated bearer context.
The ESM comprises procedures for:
- the activation, deactivation and modification of EPS bearer contexts; and
- the request for resources (IP connectivity to a PDN or dedicated bearer resources) by the UE.

Each EPS bearer context represents an EPS bearer between the UE and a PDN. EPS bearer contexts can remain activated even if the radio and S1 bearers constituting the corresponding EPS bearers between UE and MME are
temporarily released.
A default EPS bearer context is activated when the UE requests a connection to a PDN.

Once the UE is successfully attached, the UE can request the MME to set up connections to additional PDNs. For each additional connection, the MME will activate a separate default EPS bearer context. A default EPS
bearer context remains activated throughout the lifetime of the connection to the PDN.

A dedicated EPS bearer context is always linked to a default EPS bearer context and represents additional EPS bearer resources between the UE and the PDN. 
The network can initiate the activation of dedicated EPS bearer contexts together with the activation of the default EPS bearer context or at any time later, as long as the default EPS bearer
context remains activated.

Default and dedicated EPS bearer contexts can be modified.
Dedicated EPS bearer contexts can be released without affecting the default EPS bearer context. When the default EPS bearer context is released, then all dedicated EPS bearer
contexts linked to it are released, too.
The UE can request the network to allocate, modify or release additional EPS bearer resources. The network decides whether to fulfil a request for additional 
resources by activating a new dedicated EPS bearer context or modifying an existing dedicated or default EPS bearer context.

*** types of ESM procedure
**** procedures related to EPS bearer contexts(initiated by the network):
default/dedicated EPS bearer context activation;
EPS bearer context modification/deactivation;

**** Transaction related procedures(initiated by the UE to request/release  resources):

** Paging
Paging is from s1-release scenario
 ue: ECM=idle EMM=registered(guti,TAlist(TA1,TA2) in UE)

SGW get some data from the Internet, incoming donwlink data, sgw start to buffer them and request mme to estalbishment of E-RAB

SGW sent Downlink Data Notification(MME-TEID) to  mme
mme find subscirber with MME-TEID 

S-TMSI=MMEC+MTMSI 
S_TMSI is used to identify the subscirber

MME send Paging() to all the enbs(when s1-setup, enbs notify mme that its TAs) in the ta list(which is send to ue when attach accept).
enb1: own ip addr 13           enb2: ipaddr:12          mme: ipaddr:11
     Tal: Ta1, Ta2                  Tal: Ta2,Ta3              capacity: 25 


paging(S-TMSI,TA1+TA2)
-------------------------> enb1

paing(S-TMSI, TA2)
-------------------------> enb2
when ue recevied paing message from enb, it will send a service request nas messaeg to eNB


** detach procedure
detach procedure triggered by SIM card removed or cell phone is switched off.
The difference between detatch and s1-release is that detach will make SGW, MME, ENB delete all the ids it maintained for that SIM card.
while s1-release procedure is from enb(that lost connection with UE), so UE related info in ENB will be all removed, but SGW and MME may keep some info related only to UE 
other than related to enb.

Note sgw-teid have two kinds of user and control plane, but for enb-teid is just a enb-teid-u,no ebn-teid-c
after attach the ids in enb,mme,sgw
enb: enb-s1-id, mme-s1-id,      mme:imsi,enb-s1-id,mme-s1-id,                 sgw:imsi, mme-teid,

picture example: 
M means message() means parameter in message,[] means inteigiry protected message,{}means cyphered message 
A means Action. <> means stored [] means allocated

so after the attach, there are some value in the network element accordingly

ue: guti, tailist
enb: enb-s1-id, mme-s1-id, enb-teid, sgw-teid-u
sgw: imsi, mme-teid, sgw-teid-u/c, enb-teid
mme: ismi,enb-s1-id,mme-s1-id, guti, mme-teid, sgw-teid-u/c

note all the data packet won't pass mme, data only in sgw and enb(enb talk wih  ue via radio network)
other components are connected via real nettwork(core net work?) 
mme will only control the ue's guti and talist.
talist is the tas which not needed to do TAU for ue, if ue entered another tas not in talist, ue will perform TAU to mme,
mme will get updated where ue is

** Tracking Area Update
this procedure and be initiated by UE or just periodic.

*** intra mme TAU
**** ue initiated TAU 
When an UE detects it has entered a new Tracking Area(that is not in the list of TAIS when attach Accept),
it initiates a standalone tracking area update procedure.
epsupdatetype will be e-tau-updating in taurequest nas message

***** ECM=IDLE ACTIVE FLAG = OFF

**** periodic TAU
In addition, an EMM-REGISTERED and ECM-IDLE state UE performs periodic Tracking Area Update with the network after the expiry of the periodic TAU timer (T3412).
The     value of timer is sent by the network to the UE in the ATTACH ACCEPT message (and can be sent in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message). Periodic tracking area 
updateing is used to periodically notify the availability of the EMM-IDLE state UE to the network. 
epsupdatetype will be e-periodic-updating in taurequest nas message




*** inter mme TAU with ACTIVE FLAG= OFF

*** intersystem RAU
RAU is a routing area update procedure in 3G which is similar to TAU procedure in 4G, inter RAU happend between two SGSNs
intersystem RAU from 4G to 3G 
caseid: NS_48_24_0004
the Routing Area Update takes place when a UE that is registered with an MME selects a UTRAN cell.
in this case, the US changes to a Routing Area that the UE has not yet registered with the network.

UE will start a new register to UTRAN to SGSN, and SGSN will ask mme about the contexts

    Context Response

** Handover procedure
When a UE has connection to an eNB(through some cell), it is constantly measuring the signal strenths of all the
cell around it.
UE  EMM=registered ECM=connected
while UE is moving, it notices that a new cell is having a significantly stronger signal
than the current cell,then UE will send a Measurement Report to the source eNB
about the event

precondition: ATTACH and default bearer setup

*** intra mme handover through s1 interface     without SGW relocation
when ue handover from source enb to target enb, the downlink data will lost it destination for a short time.
So in S1 handover, SGW will play as a route, it forward downlink data to target enb, when SGW send downlink
data to source eNB, eNB will forward it to SGW, and SGW forward it to Target eNB, and target eNB will buffer
these data till ue handover to target ENB complete.

*** intra mme s1 handover with SGW relocation
The differce between with/without SGW relocation is that
SGW relocation means that new sgw-teid-c/u are needed, so extra Create Session Req/Resp are needed for target SGW.
and the IDFT is different
DL data flow is :  sSGW-> sENB-> sSGW ->  (tSGW) -> tENB

tSGW is an extra one compared to without SGW relocation

So there are two IDFT, 
one is 
case id: NS_130_2_0001 with SGW relocation

*** intra mme partially handover
As an operator I want that MME is able to handle the case that the target eNB does not accept one or more default bearers during a otherwise successful S1 based handover procedure in order to releases resources that are not needed any i
longer and terminate the procedure properly.
If all default bearer is in the failedsetuplist in HandvoerRequetAck message, then no continuing handover procedure IDFT creating and MBR message flow.

**** How MME know this handover need SGW relocation?
when MME received target-enb tai is different with the source-enb ta list, it will trigger DNS check state, if sgw is as the same hostname and ip, then, no sgw relocation.

*** intersystem  Gn_based Handover (ISHO) from LTE to 3G 
MME act like 3g SGSN
The source eNB sends a Handover Required message to the MME to inform that the UE has changed cell. The message contains target RNC ID. The MME determines
the target SGSN from the target RNC ID with S-NAPTR DNS inquiry (if the feature SNAPTR (Rel 8) DNS query for Gn SGSN is enabled. Otherwise, the MME uses pre-
Rel 8 DNS query). The MME maps EPS bearer(s) to PDP context(s) and provides the Release 99 parameters of the bearer QoS profile to the SGSN

**** inersystem Gn_based Handover(ISHO) from LTE to 3G multiple bearers
when there are multiple bearer, for example, two pdn default bearer, and two dedicated bearer linked to those two default bearers.
when handover, ForwardRelocationRequest will send 4 pdp contexts, ebi corresponding to nSAPI
and another field in this message:
selectionModewithNSAPI two dedicated bearer will be in that.

                 
                   
                  
*** intersystem  S3_based Handover (ISHO) from LTE to 3G using S4-SGSN
LTE to 3G S3-based handover procedure with or without S-GW relocation
When the S3-based inter-system handover feature is enabled, the MME uses the SNAPTR DNS query and requests both S3 and Gn addresses. The feature DNS query
type in S3-based inter-system handover is used to decide which is used, RAI or RNC ID, to make the DNS query.If there is a result after the S-NAPTR DNS query, the MME sends the Forward
Relocation Request message (MM context and PDN connections) to the target SGSN over the S3 interface.

As we can see here, SGSN connected directly to PGW, so teid of SGW is not necessary, when handover from 3G to LTE, mme will send creatsessionrequest to SGW
and when from LTE to 3G, mme will send deletesessionrequest to SGW for it's not useful in Gn based SGSN.

But in S3 interface, SGSN-S4 connected direct to SGW, so teid of SGW is necessary, when handover from LTE to 3G,mme won't release the sgw-teid resource(unless SGW relocated)
and when form 3G to LTE,mme won't send createsessionrequest to SGW(unless SGW relocated).

*** SRVCC handover to GERAN/UTRAN with PS HO in Gn interface.(also sv interface[MME, MSC] configured)
The core network needs to support VoIP capable LTE handsets to continue onging voice call when the user move outside of LTE coverage and the voice call is moved
to CS domain usgin 2G/3G access. This functionality is called single radio voice call continuity(SRVCC)
This functionality enables operators to reuse exsiting CS voice infrastructure in areas where LTE is not yet deployed.
The call is anchored in IMS and the UE is capable of transmitting and receiving in only one of those acess networks at a time.
The MME makes handover for the PS voice bearer towards the MSC server over the sv interface and for non-voice bearer towards SGSN over Gn interface.

network as: voice bearer was transfered through MSC, and not using SGW/PGW anymore.

PS service was transfered as follow through Gn interface:

             |           \

             |           /
ENB--------MME--------SGW

So after SRVCC PS handover, all LTE network element will release all the bearer realted resources.
ENB: ue context release command
SGW: delete session request

one dedicated bearer established later
Now travel from LTE to 3g

**** SRVCC handover with multiple bearers
case id: NS_001344_04_1015
when there are multiple bearer, for example, two pdn default bearer, and two dedicated bearer linked to those two dedicated bearers.
one of dedicated bearer is voice call bearer(qci 1)
when handover, ForwardRelocationRequest will send 3 pdp contexts, ebi corresponding to nSAPI
voice bearer  will be in SRVCC PS to CS Request




*** SRVCC from E-UTRAN to UTRAN/GERAN without packet-switched handover(PS HO)
SRVCC HO Indication:CSOnly
The UE sends measurement reports to the E-UTRAN. Based on the UE measurement reports the source E-UTRAN triggers an SRVCC handover to the UTRAN/GERAN. The
eNB sends the Handover Required message, indicating that the target is UTRAN/GERAN with only CS HO support, to the source MME, so the data service will be 
transfered to SGSN via IS RAU instead of handover.


This procedure is after attach procedure:

| SRVCC PS To CS Complete Notification & Ack | DedBR Deact Delete Bearer Cmd & Res (SGW) | IS RAU SGSN Cntx Req, Res & Ack |
| UE Cntx Rel Cmd & Cmpl | Delete Session Req & Res (SGW) |

* NACC (Network Assisted Cell Change) from UTRAN to GERAN

In today's GPRS networks (without NACC), cell re-selection can causes a service interruption in the region of 4–8 seconds, which obviously has an impact on the user experience.
Similar interruption times can be expected in mixed UMTS and GPRS networks, during UE cell re-selection from UTRAN to GERAN.
Consequences of this: e.g. TCP applications may time-out at cell change and suffer from the slow-start mechanism, streaming applications may stop at cell change due to client
buffer depletion. All such problems will lead to an unacceptable user experience.
This "Network Assisted Cell Change" feature has already been introduced in the GERAN specifications and the appropriate changes have been to the RLC/MAC protocol [TS 44.060]

* EPS session management related
Default bearer:   with new PDN addr(APN), QCI to create, with a ebi(allocated from mme side), sending (create session req) to SGW from MME to get s1-u-sgw-fteid from CSResp.
                  Then E-RAB setup procedure: sending (E-RAB setup) to ENB containing ebi, s1-u-sgw-fteid as transportlayeraddr, and Qos,APN,PDNAddr(ip).
                                              ENB response if the setup successful(with allocated s1-u-enb-fteid by ENB). if fail(no teid).
                  then seding Modify Bearer Req to SGW containing s1-u-enb-fteid. 


         
dedicated bearer: without APN, but new QCI, tft, LinkedBearIdentity(ebi of default bearer), s1-u-sgw-fteid sending (create bearer req) from SGW.(ebi of dedicated bearer will be omit)
                  multiple dedicated bearer could be established with only one LBI(LinkedBearerId) on the same default bearer for different qos level(qci), same PDN addr/ip, APN.
                  Then E-RAB setup procedure: seding (E-RAB setup) to ENB containing s1-u-sgw-fteid as transportlayeraddr, Qos, tft and ebi;
                                              ENB response(E-RAB response) if the setup successful(with s1-u-enb-fteid as transportlayeraddr).
                  then sending CreateBearerResponse to SGW containing s1-u-enb-fteid.               


For operator-based applications such as VOIP, special Qos requirements such as a constant delay and minimum bandwidth can be ensured for a particular traffica flow by 
                  establishing a dedicated bearer. IP packets flowing over a dedicated bearer use the same source IP address as packets flowing through the bearer, but destination ip
                  address(SGW_TEID) is different from defualt bearer.

** EPS bearer Qos parameter

***  Resource Type: GBR or Non-GBR
**** Resource Type = GBR (Guaranteed Bit Rate)
For an EPS bearer, having a GBR resource type means the bandwidth of the bearer is guaranteed. Obviously, a GBR type EPS bearer has a "guaranteed bit rate" associated
(GBR will be further explained below) as one of its QoS parameters. Only a dedicated EPS bearer can be a GBR type bearer and no default EPS bearer can be GBR type. 
The QCI of a GBR type EPS bearer can range from 1 to 4.


**** Resource Type = Non-GBR
For an EPS bearer, having a non-GBR resource type means that the bearer is a best effort type bearer and its bandwidth is not guaranteed. A default EPS bearer
 is always a Non-GBR bearer, whereas a dedicated EPS bearer can be either GBR or non-GBR. The QCI of a non-GBR type EPS bearer can range from 5 to 9.


***  QoS Parameters
Every EPS bearer must have QI and ARP defined. The QCI is particularly important because it serves as reference in determining QoS level for each EPS bearer.
 In case of bandwidth (bit rate), GBR and MBR are defined only in GBR type EPS bearers, whereas AMBR (APN-AMBR and UE-AMBR) is defined only in Non-GBR type EPS bearers. 

6 qos parameters
    QCI
    ARP
    GBR
    MBR
    APN-AMBR
    UE-AMBR

 
**** QCI (QoS Class Identifier)
QCI, in an integer from 1 to 9, indicates nine different QoS performance characteristics of each IP packet. QCI values are standardized to reference specific QoS characteristics, and each QCI contains standardized performance characteristics (values), such as resource type (GBR or non-GBR), priority (1~9), Packet Delay Budget (allowed packet delay shown in values ranging from 50 ms to 300 ms), Packet Error Loss Rate (allowed packet loss shown in values from 10-2 to 10-6. For more specific values, search on Google for "3GPP TS 23.203" and see Table 6.1.7 in the document. For example, QCI 1 and 9 are defined as follows:
 
QCI = 1
: Resource Type = GBR, Priority = 2, Packet Delay Budget = 100ms, Packet Error Loss Rate = 10-2 , Example Service = Voice
QCI = 9
: Resource Type = Non-GBR, Priority = 9, Packet Delay Budget = 300ms, Packet Error Loss Rate = 10-6, Example Service = Internet
 
QoS to be guaranteed for an EPS bearer or SDF varies depending on the QCI values specified.
QCI, though a single integer, represents node-specific parameters that give the details of how an LTE node handles packet forwarding (e.g. scheduling weights, admission thresholds, queue thresholds, link layer protocol configuration, etc). Network operators have their LTE nodes pre-configured to handle packet forwarding according to the QCI value.
 
By pre-defining the performance characteristics of each QCI value and having them standardized, the network operators can ensure the same minimum level QoS required by the LTE standards is provided to different services/applications used in an LTE network consisting of various nodes from multi-vendors.    
 
QCI values seem to be mostly used by eNBs in controlling the priority of packets delivered over radio links. That's because practically it is not easy for S-GW or P-GW, in a wired link, to process packets and also forward them based on the QCI characteristics all at the same time (As you may know, a Cisco or Juniper router would not care about delay or error loss rate when it processes QoS of packets. It would merely decide which packet to send first through scheduling (WFQ, DWRR, SPQ, etc.) based on the priority of the packets (802.1p/DSCP/MPLS EXP)). 


**** ARP (Allocation and Retention Priority)
When a new EPS bearer is needed in an LTE network with insufficient resources, an LTE entity (e.g. P-GW, S-GW or eNB) decides, based on ARP (an integer ranging 
from 1 to 15, with 1 being the highest level of priority), whether to:
    remove the existing EPS bearer and create a new one (e.g. removing an EPS bearer with low priority ARP to create one with high priority ARP); or
    refuse to create a new one. 

So, the ARP is considered only when deciding whether to create a new EPS bearer or not. Once a new bearer is created and packets are delivered through it, the i
ARP does not affect the priority of the delivered packet, and thus the network node/entity forwards the packets regardless of their ARP values.
One of the most representative examples of using the ARP is an emergency VoIP call. So, an existing EPS bearer can be removed if a new one is required for a emergency
 119 (911 in US, 112 in EC, etc) VoIP call. 

**** GBR (UL/DL)
This parameter is used for a GBR type bearer, and indicates the bandwidth (bit rate) to be guaranteed by the LTE network. It is
 not applied to a non-GBR bearer with no guaranteed bandwidth (UL is for uplink traffic and DL is for downlink traffic).

****  MBR (UL/DL)
MBR is used for a GBR type bearer, and indicates the maximum bit rate allowed in the LTE network. Any packets 
arriving at the bearer after the specified MBR is exceeded will be discarded.

**** APN-AMBR (UL/DL)
As you read the foregoing paragraph, you may wonder why a non-GBR type bearer does not have a "bandwidth limit"? In case of non-GBR bearers,
 it is the total bandwidth of all the non-GBR EPS bearers in a PDN that is limited, not the individual bandwidth of each bearer. And this restriction is controlled by APN-AMBR (UL/DL). As seen in the figure above, there are two non-GBR EPS bearers, and their maximum bandwidths are specified by the APN-AMBR (UL/DL)
. This parameter is applied at UE (for UL traffic only) and P-GW (for both DL and UL traffic).

**** UE-AMBR (UL/DL)
A UE can be connected to more than one PDN (e.g. PDN 1 for Internet, PDN 2 for VoIP using IMS, etc.) and it has one unique IP address for each of its all PDN connections. Here, UE-AMBR (UL/DL) indicates the maximum bandwidth allowed for all the non-GBR EPS 
bearers associated to the UE no matter how many PDN connections the UE has.
**** TFT(EPS bearer traffic flow template)
TFT is a set of all packet filters associated with that EPS bearer.
A default bearer may or may not be assocaited with a TFT.
Every dedicated EPS bearer is assocatied with a TFT.

 Other PDNs are connected through other P-GWs, this parameter is applied by eNBs only.

*** Non-Qos Parameter 
**** TFT(for default bearer)
**** 
The P-GW initiated bearer modification without QoS update is used to update the TFT
for an active default bearer, or to modify the APN-AMBR value



** Ue-initiated EPS bearer activation 

*** Default EPS bearer context activation procedure
eg. ue want a voip call, it will initiate a IMS  default bearer 
ENB:  ------>  MME - Uplink NAS Transport (PDN Connectivity Request[apn])

SGW:  <------  MME - Create Session Request
SGW:  ------>  MME - Create Session Response(sgw-teid-c[senderfteid],sgw-teid-u[s1_U-sgw_fteid])

SGW:  ------>  SUT - Modify Bearer Response(sgw-teid-c in [senderfteid],enb-teid-u in [s1_eNodeB_FTEID ])

the difference between  initial context setup request and activate eps bearer context is the former is for establishing the first default bearer,
and later for none-first default bearer; and in Dedicated EPS bearer context activation procedure, no sgw-teid-u will be allocated for it is linked with defaultbearid,
only enb-teid-u and sgw-teid-u allocated, but in Default bearer activation, there will be sgw-teid-c, sgw-teid-u and sgw-teid-c allocated.

-------------------------Media GW-------------External circuit-switched networks
Media flow(eg.voice call)          voice call           

with IMS, voice call can either go via MediaGW---->MSC or a SIP-based call handled by the IMS( circuit-switched call.)
and also, IMS an supoort MMTel which is voip call.this is the LTE voice service mostly used.(ps call)

** voice call continuous between LTE coverage and not coveraged area
There are three different use cases that need to be considered:
1. A voice call is established when in LTE coverage (dark area), and the user is not moving outside LTE coverage during the duration of the call. For this use
case, MMTel would be used to provide the voice service over LTE.

2. A voice call is established when outside LTE coverage (light area). The call would then instead be established using circuit-switched access over, for example, GSM.
Depending on the solution, the call could be converted into a SIP-based call and handled by the IMS system, or it can be handled as a traditional circuit-switched call by the MSC.

3. A voice call is established when in LTE coverage (dark area) and during the voice call, the user moves outside LTE coverage. If the system depicted as
a light area can support IMS/MMTel voice services, this would be handled through a ‘Packet Handover’ between LTE and the other system (e.g. WCDMA/
HSPA or eHRPD) and the voice service would continuously be served as an IP-based service and handled by the IMS infrastructure. If this is not the
case, specific measures are needed to secure service continuity when LTE coverage is lost. The 3GPP solution for this is called Single-Radio Voice Call Continuity (SRVCC).

From above, we can see convergence between LTE and 3g/2g network, when ue leave the LTE, voip call(IMS/MMTel) could be continued if the cell supoorted voip even if the cell is not
E-utran. if the cell not E-utran not support the voip, then srvcc is a way to handover the voice call to MSC.


** EPS SRVCC and CSFB
CSFB x SRVCC:

    It is not necessary to implement both solutions (CSFB and SRVCC) at the same time, if the network has a wide LTE coverage and a complete IMS backbone.
        If we implemente CSFB, it means we will not make the call setup using existing IMS Core, and that could take care of that call in LTE.
        In respect to the SRVCC: assuming the Backbone IMS is available. In this case, if the register in the IMS is successful, the user do not need to do CSFB - A voice call can be simply initiated in LTE network using IMS.
    CSFB is a service handover procedure while SRVCC is a coverage handover procedure.


LTE voice issue:
in overalll 2/3/4G network, voice call has two forms:
1. call suppported by IMS Core (this is a VOLTE/VOIP feature, and when ue swith from 4g to 3g, srvcc handover occured)
in LTE env(EUTRAN), the voice call is from ENB--->SGW-----PGW---->IMS Core
in UTRAN, the voice call is from UTRAN----->MSC--------->IMS Core
So as long as svrcc handover from MME to MSC, 

2. tranditional circuit call  (UE anchored both in LTE and 3G, when mo/to(mobile originate/mobile terminal) call, ue will fall back to 3g network)
tranditoinal circuit call is from UTAN------>MSC (no IMS core)

So when UE move between those 2/3/4g network the cell not supported voip, there are 2 different mechanism to support voice call.
SRVCC is for handing over from S/PGW----->IMS  to MSC----->IMS
CSFB  is not handover,it just fallback to CS domain whenever it need a voice call which means even in LTE coverage area, ue just fallback to CS domain to call.
so CSFB need cell phone support dual mode, update Location also in CS domain when UE moved around, also update tracking area also.



** SRVCC (Single Radio Voice Call Coninuity)
widely supported in the industry and has been recommended by the LTE OneVoice Initiative.
if mobile only single Mode, SRVCC capable
while it is able to transmit or receive on only one of these access networks at a given time.

there is option  SRVCCHOIndication is 'cSonly' in HandoverRequired Message.
if so, no ps handover required, if is 'PSandCS', then PS handover required.

*** SRVCC from E-UTRAN to GERAN/UTRAN precondition (how SRVCC will happen when ue moved)
E-UTRAN may determine the NCL, as well as the need to signal a SRVCC indication, as follows:

 If the “SRVCC operation possible” indication is set to “true” (i.e. both EPC and UE are SRVCC capable),then VoIP-incapable cells 
 may be included as candidate target cells in the NCL, regardless of the presence of an established QCI=1 bearer for this UE. Moreover:

 If there is an established QCI=1 bearer for this UE and the selected target cell is VoIP-capable,then  EUTRAN does not include a 
 SRVCC indication in the Handover Required message;

 If there is an established QCI=1 bearer for this UE and the selected target cell is VoIP-incapable, then EUTRAN includes a SRVCC indication in the Handover Required message;

 If there is no established QCI=1 bearer for this UE, then E-UTRAN does not include a SRVCC indication in the Handover Required  message;

 If the “SRVCC operation possible” indication is set to “false” (i.e.either EPC or UE is not SRVCC capable), then E-UTRAN does not include a SRVCC indication
 in the Handover Required message.

 If there is an established QCI=1 bearer for this UE, then VoIP-incapable cell are not be included in the NCL;

 If there is no established QCI=1 bearer for this UE, then VoIP-incapable cells may be included in the NCL.


** CSFB  (Circuit Swithed Fall Back)
ue anchored both in LTE and CS domain, using combined attach both to MME and MSC.
3gpp doc 23272
The main idea behind CS fallback is to allow UEs to camp on LTE and utilize the LTE for data services but resuse the GSM,WCDMA,CDMA network for circuit-switched voice services.
So CSFB's precondition is ue combined attach to both MME and MSC: this also required mobile support dual mode

*** combined attach procedure
Normal attach procedure with AttachReq(Attach Type=Combined Attach), attatch to MSC also.
After Create Session Req/Res,

      SGsAP-update-Location-Req    
MME   -------------------------------------->MSC
         SGSAP-update-location-Accept
So mme has a link with MSC

Normal imis attach, and after createsessionresponse from SGW, mme send sgsap-location-update-request to MSC/VLR,
If the UE includes TMSI status in the Attach Request, the MME delivers it to the MSC/VLR in the Location Update Request. If the MME receives TMSI in the Location Update Accept
from the MSC/VLR, the MME includes the TMSI in the Attach Accept message to the UE. If new TMSI was allocated, the UE confirms the received TMSI by sending the Attach Complete message 
to the MME. If the MME receives the Attach Complete message before attach/TAU request response timer (T3450)

easily do this action a "canonical" node name shall be employed so that the "canonical" node names from two or more
sets of records can be compared to see if nodes are actually the same nodes, or topologically closer nodes.

The host names shall have form:
<"topon" | "topoff"> . <single-label-interface-name> . <canonical-node-name>
Where the first label is "topon" or "topoff" to indicate whether or not collocated and topologically close node selection
shall be preferred, "single-label-interface-name" is a single label used to name a specific interface on a node (e.g. Eth-0,
S8, vip, board3), "canonical-node-name" is a the canonical node name of a specific node. A node shall have exactly one
canonical node name so a host name always includes the unique canonical node name of the node.Hence, when
comparing the host name FQDNs to find out

* EPS AKA(Authentication Key agreement) procedure
In EPS key agreement is very easy, since imsi know its own K, and HSS know the imsi's K also(MME could get from authentication info requst).
So in fact, they already had a common private key.
